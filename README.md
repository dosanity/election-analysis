# election-analysis
Tom is on the Colorado Board of Elections employee in an election audit of the tabulated results for U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorado. We are tasked with reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. We are looking to automate the process using Python so that we can use the code to audit other congressional districts, senatorial districts, and local elections. In this analysis, we will research three different voting methods: Mail-in ballots, punch cards, and Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) counting machines. Mail-in ballots are typically hand counted at the central office. Punch cards are collected and then fed into a machine that tabulates vote totals and sends the results to the central office. Finally, memory cards from DRE counting machiens are sent to the central office and read by a computer. The votes cast by these three methods will determine the final election results. We are generating a vote count report to certify the U.S. congressional race.
